# Mintlify Documentation Clone

### [Live Demo on Vercel](https://chirag-jaipal.github.io/mintlify-clone/)

## Project Overview
This is a desktop-first recreation of the **Mintlify** landing page. The project focuses on content structure and documentation-style layouts using only pure HTML and CSS, as per the **Web Dev Cohort 2026** requirements.

## Recreated Sections
I have built all **10 required sections**:
* **Header & Hero:** Navigation bar and the main headline with the email CTA.
* **Doc Preview:** Sidebar-style navigation paired with main content cards.
* **Feature Showcases:** "Trusted By" logos, two-column feature highlights, and a large UI mockup.
* **Enterprise & Social:** Feature blocks for security/compliance and card-based customer stories.
* **Final CTA & Footer:** Strong closing heading and a multi-column footer.

## Technical Details
* **Technology:** 100% Pure HTML and CSS.
* **Typography:** Used the **Inter** font via Google Fonts to match the clean documentation aesthetic.
* **Layout Logic:** Used **CSS Grid** specifically for the Sidebar/Content alignment to ensure structural accuracy.
